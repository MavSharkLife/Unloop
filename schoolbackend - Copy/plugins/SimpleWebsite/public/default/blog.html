        <li><h2>12/3/2024 - New Rule, and Eaglercraft 1.12 news!!<span class="subText"> - edited 12/4/2024</span></h2><p>Hello! recently I found that a lot of 1 person nations have formed. Now, I'm not super mad, but the whole point of the Nation server type is for people to work together to make a wonderful nation, with incredible builds, and to conquer other nations, but you can't really do that in a 1 person nation.<br>That is why I made <a href="rules.html#r20">a new rule</a>, it states that&quot;1 Person nations are not allowed&quot;, &quot;If a nation is found to only have 1 member after 4 days of the nation being created, it will be disbanded.&quot;, and &quot;If you break this rule 2 times, you will be banned from creating new factions for 60 days.&quot;<br style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">Boring rule stuff aside, Eaglercraft 1.12 news time.<br>Recently the developers of Eaglercraft 1.12 have announced that they will be making it public later this week, they also mentioned that it's likely there will be quite a bit of bugs at first. So to make us of help, and to test how buggy Eaglercraft 1.12 is, I will be making Eaglercraft 1.12 the default client on this website. Please if you run into any bugs let me know so I can let the developers know about it, so they know what to fix. If the bugs do cause too much of an issue though, don't worry, the server will still be 1.8, and I will still leave the 1.8 Eaglecraft client on the website, accessible by holding the &quot;O&quot; key while clicking the &quot;Play!&quot; button, or you can click the arrow by the play button, and select &quot;EaglercraftX <em>&lpar;1.8&rpar;</em>&quot;<br>Once we find that Eaglercraft 1.12 is stable enough I will change the server to a 1.12 server. Currently how I'm thinking I'll do that, is I will just keep the same world we have, and I'll extend it to introduce the new 1.12 world generation.<br style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>EDIT:</strong> sorta related to this, but there's now a EaglercraftX WASM client you can use, using the little arrow by the play button as similarily mentioned in this blog post initially.<br style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">Well that was a lot of stuff, probably the biggest blog post, not sure how to end a blog post, I guess just, hope you're enjoying the server so far!</p></li>
        <li><h2>11/21/2024 - Website has a github now!<span class="subText"> - edited 11/24/2024</span></h2><p>Recently I noticed that it's going to take a while for me to make all the pages I want for this server. So I made a way for you all to help and contribute to the site! If you go to <a class="external" href="https://github.com/Millymilo000/milssillyserver-website">https://github.com/Millymilo000/milssillyserver-website</a> you'll find a repository with all the code for the website, if you have a github account you can make a fork of the repository, edit the things you want of it, and then make a pull request with your new updates! I don't really expect anyone to help and contribute, but if you would like to, there is an option now.</p></li>
        <li><h2>11/10/2024 - Server will be open for all* to join!<span class="subText"> - edited 11/17/24</span></h2><p>It will become public on 11/19/24!! Hope to see you then!<br>That's right, sometime during this month I will be reseting the server and will be making it public! And by public I more so mean public to anyone in the same school district as me. To join, open <a class="external" id="form" href="#">this form</a> <strong>on your school email</strong> (if you're on your school account and it lets you access the form then that means you're in the same district!), and fill the neccessary details. Once you submit it Ill try to email you back on whether or not you got accepted! I hope this leads to everyone having fun on this server, and please don't fall behind on your school work because of this.</p></li>
        <li><h2>10/1/2024 - Cool guide I made <span class="subText">- edited 10/2/2024</span></h2><p>Hi there, I spent a huge amount of my time writing a cool guide on how you can host your own EaglercraftX server the same way I do, along with instructions on how to host a client, and website along with it. If you're interested please <a href="guide/">take a look</a></p></li>
        <li><h2>8/14/2024 - Server Type is setup, new world!</h2><p>The outcome of the poll was a Nation server, so so far not much change, I'll probably update the rules and stuff just to make somethings more clear but yea.<br>If you're seeing this then that likely means the server is up and ready to be played with a new world! Please enjoy.</p></li>
        <li><h2>8/8/2024 - Possible server type change?</h2><p>Hello, been awhile since the last blog post, anyway because school will be starting up and people are more likely to actually want to play, I'm going to restart the server world. With that being said I also want to make sure that everyone enjoys the server, which is why I'm holding a poll to have you guys vote on what kind of server you want it to be.<br>The current types that you can vote on are...<br><br>A simple, friendly, survival building server.<ul><li>This is what the server started as, where killing, stealing, griefing, etc. are disallowed, there are no faction plugins, and a dynmap is there for everyone to see where anyone is.</li></ul><br>A nation server.<ul><li>This is the type we tried during the summer, where killing, stealing, griefing etc. are only allowed during wars, wars can only start with specific situations, people are encouraged to make a faction with multiple people and stay in one base, people are encouraged to be diplomatic with other nations, and a dynmap is also there. (Just want to say that, I know that this didn't work all too well during this summer, but I imagine during the school year where more people are likely to be more active, it'll be a lot more fun.)</li></ul><br>Or maybe a faction server.<ul><li>We have not done this type whatsoever, this is chaos, killing, stealing, griefing, etc. are allowed, period. People are encouraged to be in a faction with people, and dominate the server. A dynmap would not be there, in order to keep people safe, and their bases hidden.</li></ul><br>You can vote on this by either texting me, telling me in person, telling someone who has contact with me, or (preferably) joining the discord server linked above and voting in the #announcements channel. If you have any questions about this please ask me. The poll ends on August 13th, at 12 PM.</p></li>
        <li><h2>5/19/2024 - Grace period ended</h2><p>As you can read in the title the grace period has ended! This means that you are now able to request CBs to go to war with other people, and some other things such as killing people outside of their land! If you want to request a CB to send a message in the #cb-requests channel on discord or just reach out to me giving evidence of the CB and all info needed. If you haven't already please read all the rules so you can know how this server works with CBs and raiding and such.</p></li>
        <li><h2>5/17/2024 - Reset complete!</h2><p>The reset has been complete! The server is now factions, I suggest you read the rules for it <a href="rules.html">here</a>, and hop on the server and enjoy!<br>Do know with this, I haven't really used this plugin too much so I could've put a config wrong or something, so if you find any issues with it just please let me know.<br>Also the world for the previous server will be sent in the announcements channel on the discord server. If you are not in it then just email me and I'd be happy to send it to you.</p></li>
        <li><h2>5/13/2024 - Reseting the server to factions</h2><p>Hello! As you can read in the title, sometime this week, or when school ends, I will be reseting the server to be a faction server. The world, our items, and locations will be reset, although if you're in the discord server (or email me) I will be sending the current server world for you to archive a look at. I'll be using the factionsUUID plugin for it, and with it being factions will come new rules that you can see in the rules tab. The world will be a 8000x8000 world pre-generated with a fully rendered map and no villages (zombie villagers will still spawn and are still curable). During this new server I'll likely add some new plugins along the way, so expect to enjoy that!<br>It's sort of my first time hosting a server with this plugin, so if you have any issues or suggestions with it please let me know.</p></li>

        <p>
            In this Nation Server, when someone wants to begin a war they have to do that using Casus-Belli requests &lpar;CBs&rpar; and War requests.
            <br>Currently the only way to create CB requests is using the <a class="external" id="discord" href="#">discord server</a>. But eventually I plan on creating a better way without the discord server.

        <h2 id="linking">Linking your Discord to your Minecraft username to use the Discord server</h2>
        <p>Before making a request using discord you will need to link your Discord to your minecraft username on the server. It's a very simple and quick process.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First join the discord server using this invite link <a class="external" id="discordInner"></a></li>
            <li>Then run the command &quot;/discord link&quot;, 
                <ul><li>it should give you a string of numbers, note the numbers down.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Go back to the discord server, look in the members list and open Direct messages with the &quot;silly SRV&quot; bot.</li>
            <li>Send the string of numbers that &quot;&sol;discord link&quot; gave you in step 2.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now you should be able to see all the channels!</p>
        <h2 id="makingCbRequest">Making a CB request.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To start maing a CB Request, first navigate to the &quot;cb-requests&quot; channel.</li>
            <li>Start writing out a new message with this format
                <br>[Your nation] Nation name
                <br>[Enemy nation] Enemy nation name
                <br>[Casus-Belli] Casus Belli type
                <br>[Evidence] Can be an image or whatever to prove that the enemy nation did that CB
                <ul><li>You can create new lines by doing shift&plus;enter.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Replace &quot;Nation name&quot; with the name of your nation.</li>
            <li>Replace &quot;Enemy nation name&quot; with the name of the nation you are making this cb request on.
                <ul><li>You can do &sol;f who &lt;username&gt; &lpar;Replacing &quot;&lt;username&gt;&quot; with the persons username&rpar; to find the name of the nation that person is in.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Replace &quot;Casus Belli type&quot; with the type of casus belli you're doing.
                <ul><li>You can find a list of these in the <a href="../rules.html#cb">rules page</a></li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Replace &quot;Can be an image or whatever to prove that the enemy nation did that CB&quot; with whatever evidence you have to justify the Casus Belli request.
                <br>This can be something like
                <ul>
                    <li>A message link to a message in the &quot;ingame-chat&quot; channel.</li>
                    <li>An image with proof it's from the server.</li>
                    <li>The time and place of when an event happened. &lpar;Only if it can be realisticly found from the logs, such as a block break, or entity kill.&rpar;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once you've filled out all the neccessary stuff, just send the message and wait for a staff member to see it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once a staff member sees the CB request, they'll send a message saying whether it was accepted or denied, and sometimes a thread may be made to discuss some things before it's accepted or denied.
            <br>Once it's accepted you have usually 2 weeks to make a war request using that CB.
        </p>
        <h2 id="makingWarRequest">Making a War Request</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To start making a War request, first navigate to the &quot;wars&quot; channel.</li>
            <li>Start writing out a new message with this format
                <br>[Your nation] Nation name
                <br>[Enemy nation] Enemy nation name
                <br>[Casus-Belli used] Message link to cb request 
            </li>
            <li>Replace &quot;Nation name&quot; with the name of your nation.</li>
            <li>Replace &quot;Enemy nation name&quot; with the name of the nation you are making this cb request on.</li>
            <li>Replace &quot;Message link to cb request&quot; with a message link to the accepted CB Request you are using to justify this war.
                <ul><li>You can grab the message link by right clicking or clicking the &quot;More&quot; button when hovering over a message, and selecting the &quot;Copy Message Link&quot; button.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once you've filled out all the neccessary stuff, just send the message and wait for a staff member to see it.</li>
            <li>Once a staff member accepts the War request, a thread will be made on the channel, where you will need to discuss when the war will start.</li>
            <li>After the war is ended, in that same thread the winning nation will have to send all their post-war actions, once they are checked and accepted by a staff member, the losing nation will have to follow along with those post-war actions.</li>
